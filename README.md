- Age and gender estimation using computer vision
- Context-aware response generation using LLM
- Deployed on a physical robot for interactive learning

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- Deep learning model for age/gender detection
- Large Language Model (LLM) for response generation

## How to Run
1. Clone the repo
2. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
